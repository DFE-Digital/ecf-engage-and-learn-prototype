      <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Have NQTs from your school’s 2020 cohort had their induction disrupted because of the COVID-19 pandemic?</p>

<p>They can now use our accredited self-study materials to help them develop their skills and knowledge.</p>

<p>We just need you to <a href="/nqt1/it2/choose">choose the materials you’d like to use (there are 4 options), and the names and email addresses]</a> of the teachers so we can set everything up for them. </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p><strong>Teacher Continuing Professional Development</strong><br>
Department for Education</p>
