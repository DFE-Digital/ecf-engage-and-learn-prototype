      <p>Hello,</p>
      <p>
        Your school has created a GOV.UK account where you can access support materials designed to help you hone your teaching skills and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is that you focus on any development areas you missed out on during your first year of teaching. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To sign in to your account, go to the <a href="https://ecf-engage-and-learn-review-pr-240.london.cloudapps.digital/">Support for early career teachers</a> service on GOV.UK.</p>
      <p>
        Thanks,<br>
        The Teacher Continuing Professional Development team
      </p>
