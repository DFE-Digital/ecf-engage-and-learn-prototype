      <p>Hi [Add first name],</p>

      <p>
      Your school has created a GOV.UK account for you to access self-study materials for the training and support programme youâ€™ll be doing during your first 2 years of teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        To sign in to your account, go to the service on GOV.UK.</p>

        <p><a href="#">Add actual url link to review app (notify rules)</a></p>

      <p>
        You will need the email address your school used when they created your account. This will probably be your work email.
      </p>
<p>
  Thanks,<br>
  The Teacher Continuing Professional Development team
