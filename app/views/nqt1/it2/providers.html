    <p>You can choose from 4 options. They all cover the same theory and practical classroom techniques aligned to the teachers’ standards. You should choose the one that best fits your school’s needs. </p>

<p>These materials were designed for early career teachers doing the new 2-year induction programme, so you might find this cohort has already covered some of the content. We therefore recommend focusing on development areas that were disrupted by the pandemic.</p>
