<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Introduction</h2>

<p>This module focuses on Teachers’ Standards 1 and 7. These can be considered as foundational to your teaching because they address how you set up your classroom as a learning environment.

  As you work through the weeks of this module you will reflect on the different ways that you can influence your environment, and learn practical strategies that keep pupils safe, motivated and focused on learning.</p>
