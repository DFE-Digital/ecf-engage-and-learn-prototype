      <p>Hello,</p>

      <p>
        Was your statutory induction training disrupted because of the pandemic?
      </p>

    <p>Your school has created a GOV.UK account where you can access materials designed to help you hone your teaching skills and knowledge.</p>

    <p>It’s entirely optional, but the idea is that you focus on any development areas you missed out on during the pandemic.</p>

    <p>You can use the materials now until the summer of 2022.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Why you’ve been selected</h3>


    <p>We are specifically offering help to teachers at state-funded schools who either:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>completed their induction in the 2020 to 2021 academic year</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Or</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>had started but not yet completed their induction by 1 September 2021</li>
    </ul>


<br>

<p>To sign in to your account, go to:</p>

    <p><a href="/nqt1-teachers/it2/start">http://support-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/start</a></p>

      <p>You will need the email address your school used when they created your account.</p>

<p>
  Thanks,<br>
  The Teacher Continuing Professional Development team
