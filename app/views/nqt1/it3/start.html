        Extra support for NQTs who had their induction disrupted by the pandemic
      </h1>

      <p>Do you have NQTs from the 2020 to 2021 cohort who missed out on having a normal induction because of the pandemic?</p>

      <p>We are offering 2 things to help them during the next academic year:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>free online resources NQTs can use to develop their skills and knowledge </li>
        <li>a one-off payment to go towards giving NQTs extra development time </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Who is eligible
      </h3>

      <p>This offer is for state school teachers who either completed their induction in the 2020 to 2021 academic year or have not yet completed their induction. </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m ">
        Online resources to help fill knowledge and skills gaps during the next academic year
      </h3>

      <p>We are offering NQTs access throughout their second year of teaching to the same resources early career teachers (ECTs) use on the new 2-year induction programme.</p>

<p>These materials feature a wide range of theory and practical classroom techniques aligned to the teachers’ standards.</p>

<p>NQTs will only be able to use these resources for 3 terms. To get the best out of them they should:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>focus on development areas disrupted by the pandemic. There’s no need to try covering all the material</li>
  <li>dip in and out of them rather than following the prescribed week by week structure</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that mentor meetings and associated practical exercises featured in the resources only apply to ECTs doing the 2-year programme. </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m ">Choose resources and set up access for the NQTs</h3>

<p>You can choose resources from one of 4 DfE-accredited providers: </p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Ambition Institute</li>
  <li>Education Development Trust</li>
<li>Teach First</li>
<li>UCL Career Teacher Consortium</li>
</ul>

<p>They all cover the same subject matter, but each takes a different approach. Check this <a href="#">overview of the resources on offer (opens in a new tab)</a>if you are not familiar with them.</p>

<p>If you would like your NQTs to use these resources during their second year of teaching, <a href="/nqt1/it3/choose">choose your materials and let us know the teachers’ details</a>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Additional time to invest in teacher development</h3>

<p>We want to help NQTs focus on development areas they missed out on during their first year of teaching.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we will give schools a one-off payment equivalent to a 5% (roughly 44 hours) timetable reduction per teacher over the next academic year. </p>

<p>NQTs from the 2020 to 2021 cohort will each attract payments of £1,200 if they teach outside London, rising to £1,300 in the ‘fringe area’ around London, £1,400 in Outer London and £1,500 in Inner London.</p>

<p>We will make the payment in the summer term of 2022. We will let you know how it will be processed at a later date.</p>

<p>Your school will still be eligible if you employ NQTs who move following their induction.</p>
