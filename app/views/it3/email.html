<p>Hi Joe,</p>

<p>
  Your school has set up a GOV.UK account for you to access self-study materials for the training and support programme youâ€™ll be doing during your first 2 years of teaching.
</p>
<p>
  To access your account, go to the <a href="/it3/home">Coaching and mentoring for early career teachers</a> service on GOV.UK.
</p>
<p>
  You will need a valid email address and your teacher reference number.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks,<br>
  The Coaching and mentoring for early careers teachers team
